## ABSTRACT

The emergence of noisy medium-scale quantum devices has led to proof-of-concept applications for quantum computing in various domains. Examples include Natural Language
Processing (NLP) where sentence classification experiments have been carried out, as well
as procedural generation, where tasks such as
geopolitical map creation, and image manipulation have been performed. We explore applications at the intersection of these two areas
by designing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for sentence generation.
Our algorithm is based on the well-known simulated annealing technique for combinatorial
optimisation. An implementation is provided
and used to demonstrate successful sentence
generation on both simulated and real quantum
hardware. A variant of our algorithm can also
be used for music generation.
This paper aims to be self-contained, introducing all the necessary background on NLP and
quantum computing along the way

For the **QHACK 2023 OPEN CHALLENGE** I implemented the paper **Quantum Natural Language Generation on Near-Term Devices**, published on   1st November 2022 and be found via link:

## ABSTRACT

The emergence of noisy medium-scale quantum devices has led to proof-of-concept applications for quantum computing in various domains. Examples include Natural Language
Processing (NLP) where sentence classification experiments have been carried out, as well
as procedural generation, where tasks such as
geopolitical map creation, and image manipulation have been performed. We explore applications at the intersection of these two areas
by designing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for sentence generation.
Our algorithm is based on the well-known simulated annealing technique for combinatorial
optimisation. An implementation is provided
and used to demonstrate successful sentence
generation on both simulated and real quantum
hardware. A variant of the algorithm can also
be used for music generation.
ThE paper also aimed to be self-contained, introducing all the necessary background on NLP and
quantum computing along the way




## Some  Background on QNLP
The current state of QNLP has by large extent been developed on **Diagramatic Quantum Theory**, Diagrammatic Quantum Theory (DQT) is a mathematical framework for understanding and calculating quantum systems using diagrams as a visual representation

One of the key advantages of DQT is that it provides a way to simplify complex quantum staes, especially sequential ones such as language. Specifically, String diagrams provides a way to express nonseparable and separable processes in a diagrammatic fashion as seen in the diagram below.
